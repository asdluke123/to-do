## Inital Thought Process 
### When I first got the problem I thouroughly read through the the overview of the problem and what requiremnts needed to be met. I then planned out what functioanllity and variables I would need to make the application. I wrote pseudocode on a text file  to help prepare a track of what things need to be done.

 ## Starting the application

 ### After creating the react app and downloading all my dependices I started on the login page and creating all the elements.  It took me around an hour and a half to complete all the functionallity and design for the page. The couple problems I ran into while creating this page was working with a formData post to an API as I was unfamiliar with the that specific way of hitting an API and then lastly placing everything on the page where I wanted it and putting Icons within input fields that stayed on place based on resolution.

 ## To-Do list process 
 ### After finishing the login page the to-do list page took me a little over two hours to complete. I was fairly comfortable dealing with state tracking as I have previous experience creating my own todo application so creating the logic for editing and deletion for individual todos was something I was confident I could do. The main time consumption for the list page was the CSS and creating affects for all my elements like animations and style turanries based off the current state of the application.

## Design 
### For the layout design of my application I followed close to the mockups given to me as layout design is not one of my strong suits but something I am contiuning to improve upon. The color of the application was inspired by Rapptr's logo design. I utilized MUI's components for styling of buttons and to utilize thier icon library. I used React-Toast to alert the user when a to-do was created and to also display what todo they just deleted.I decided to disable the creation of a new todo when the app is in a search or edit state just so the user is focused on the current state of the app (I.E when editing a todo they are focused on the editing. When searching they are focused on the search).
